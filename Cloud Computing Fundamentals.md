# Part 1: Understanding Cloud Concepts

* Understanding Cloud Concepts (chapter 1-2)

* Cloud Architecture (chapter 3 - 6)

Cloud computing has changed how businesses operate. It offers features like on-demand resources, easy scaling and flexible costs. This has empowered startups to compete with established players and helped existing businesses improve and transform.

It was initially about saving money, now businesses see the cloud as a tool for major changes. Companies use a mix of public and private cloud services depending on their needs. Letting them keep sensitive applications in-house while using innovative cloud-based software and services.

The definition of cloud computing may be confusing. There are 5 characteristics have been agreed upon for a basic understanding of what cloud computing means.

**On-Demand Self-Services**

Consumers can provision resources as needed and automatically. Cloud services consumers can provision services on an as-needed basis, without the need to work with the CSP(Cloud Service Provider)  directly. These resources might include compute power, additional storage, new websites even database services. The consumer can expand or reduce these services without human assistance from the CSP.

**Broad Network Access**

Services available across the network from commonly available clients. Client devices and traditional server deployments are able to access cloud-based resources across the network. The network might include the local on-premises network or the internet or both. Cloud resources have the potential to be globally accessible.

**Resource Pooling**

**Multitenant model**: Multiple users share the same pool of resources managed by the cloud services provider (CSP).

**On-demand allocation**:Resources like network, storage and computing power are allocated to users as needed, not pre-signed. 

**Location transparency**: User don't know  or care where the physical resources are located.

**Dynamic management**: The CSP automatically manages and adjusts resource allocation to optimize usage.

The CSP acts like a giant pool of computing power, storage and network capabilities. Users can tap into this pool and get resources they need, when they need them, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

**rapid elasticity**

**Traditional IT:** Businesses buy physical servers (capital expenditure), which are fixed in terms of cost and capabilities. This can be wasteful if resource needs fluctuate.

**Demand Fluctuation:** Many businesses experience varying resource needs throughout the year. For example, a retail store might need more computing power during peak holiday seasons.

**Cloud's Advantage:** Cloud computing allows for dynamic allocation of resources. You can easily provision (add) or release (remove) resources like storage and processing power based on real-time needs. This can be done automatically or manually.

**Efficiency:** Rapid elasticity avoids the situation of having underutilized servers most of the year. You only pay for what you use, leading to significant cost savings on hardware purchase and maintenance.

**Measured Services**

**Resource Metering:** Cloud service providers (CSPs) track how much of their resources (storage, compute power, etc.) users consume.

Benefits of Metering:
  * **Efficient Allocation**: By understanding usage patterns, CSPs can allocate resources more effectively, optimizing their infrastructure.
    
  * **Accurate Billing**: Metering allows CSPs to bill users precisely for the resources they actually used, leading to a fair pay-as-you-go model.


# Cloud Computing Ecosystem

It consists of 3 categories:

**Consumers of Service**:

**Store files**: Upload and keep documents, photos, videos, and other data in the cloud.

**Access from anywhere**: Retrieve files from any device with an internet connection, be it a computer, phone, or tablet.

**Share and collaborate**:Share files and folders with others, enabling teamwork and document editing in real-time.

**Provider of Services**

Cloud Service Providers offer a wide variety of cloud solutions, encompassing storage, compute power, platform for app development, and pre-built applications and tools. 

We have several Cloud Service Providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform(GCP), IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and Alibaba Cloud.

Each provider has its strength but all offer core services like:

**Infrastructure-as-a-Software (IaaS)**: Rent computing resources like virtual approved machines, storage, and networking.

**Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**: Develop, deploy, and manage, applications on a cloud platform.

**Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): Use pre-built cloud applications like email, CRM, or productivity tools.

**Understanding Cloud Concepts**

Delivers shared computing resources like storage, applications, and processing power over the internet. Makes IT resources easier to use through standardization and automation.

**Standardization and Automation**:

*Standardization:* Ensures services are delivered consistently using commom interfaces.

*Automation:* Automates processes based on rules like security, resource availability.

It allows for:
 *Self-service provisioning*: Users can access resources on-demand without IT intervention

 
 *Efficient resource management*: Resources are automatically returned to the pool when not needed.

examples of cloud services:

  * Microsoft 365

  * Slack
