*Entities and Tables*

Entities are real-world things you want to track information about. Examples: customers, products, orders.
Tables are like folders in the filing cabinet. Each table holds information about a specific type of entity.

*Rows and Instances*

Rows are like individual files within a folder. Each row represents a single instance of an entity.
For example, a row in the "customers" table represents one specific customer, with their details.
Real-world Example: Retail System
Customers table: Each row contains information about one customer (name, address, contact details).
Products table: Each row describes a single product (name, price, description).
Orders table: Each row represents a single order (order number, date, customer ID).
Line items table: Each row details a product included in an order (order number, product ID, quantity).
In essence:

A relational database organizes information into tables.
Each table stores data about a specific type of thing (entity).
Each row within a table represents a single instance of that thing.
