# Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud

**High availability**

When deploying an application or service or IT resource, it is important that the resources are available when needed. 

High availability focuses on making sure there is maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur. When architecting a solution, you'll need to account for services availability guarantees. Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the services.

**Scalability**

Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demands. another benefit of scalability is that you are not overpaying for services, because cloud is a consumption-based model, you pay for what you use. If the demand drops, you can reduce your resources and thereby reduce your costs.

In scaling, there are two varieties: vertical and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling focuses on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources. Horizontal scaling refers to adding or subtracting the number of resources.

**Vertical Scaling**

With vertical scaling, if you were developing an app and you need more processing power, you could vertically scale up to add more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine.

**Horizontal Scaling**

# Summary

High availability ensures that your applications and services are available to users most of the time, even if there are disruptions.
Cloud providers typically offer uptime guarantees as part of their service-level agreements (SLAs).

Scalability allows you to adjust resources up or down to meet demand. This means you can handle spikes in traffic without compromising performance and avoid paying for unused resources during low-demand periods. 
There are two main types of scaling: vertical scaling (adding or removing processing power to a single resource) and horizontal scaling (adding or removing entire resources).
