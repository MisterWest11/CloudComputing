Key layers:

  * Physical security: Protecting physical access to facilities and equipment.

  * Identity & Access Management: Controlling who can access the systems and data.

  * Network Security: protecting the network infrastructure from threats.

  * Compute layer security: Securing virtual and physical servers.

  * Application security: protecting applications from vulnerabilities.

  * Data security: Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.

Its main goal is to protect the CIA triad:

  * Confidentiality: Keeping sensitive info secret.

  * Integrity: Ensuring data accuracy and relaibility.

  * Availability: Making data accessible when needed.
