# Describe factors that can affect costs in Azure

Azure offers a pay-as-you-go model (OpEx) instead of upfront (CapEx) for infrastructure. 
This means businesses only pay for the computing, storage and network resources they actually use.

Azure costs can vary based on several factors: 

  * Resource type: Different services like storage or virtual machines have different pricing structures.

  * Resource settings: configurations such as performance, storage capacity and region can impacthe cost.

  * Usage: The amount of resources consumed directly affects the bill.

**Consumption**:

*Pay-as-you-go*: Flexible model where you pay for what you use.

*Reservations*: Commit to using a specific amount of resources for a discount (up to 72%). Offers a balance between flexibility and cost savings.

**Maintenance**:

*Resource management*: Proper management of resources (e.g., VMs, storage) can prevent unnecessary costs.

*Resource groups*: Organizing resources can help with cost control.

**Geography**:

*Regional pricing*: Costs vary based on location due to factors like power, labor, and taxes.

*Network traffic*: Data transfer costs are influenced by the distance between locations.

*Network Traffic*:

*Bandwidth charges*: Apply to data moving in and out of Azure datacenters.

*Billing zones*: Geographic groupings used for calculating data transfer costs.

**Subscription Type**:

*Usage allowances*: Some subscriptions offer free services or credits.

**Azure Marketplace**:

*Third-party costs*: In addition to Azure usage, you might pay for vendor services or software.

Overall, Azure costs are influenced by a combination of factors, including usage patterns, resource choices, geographic location, and subscription type. 
Effective cost management requires careful planning and monitoring.

# Compare the Pricing and Total Cost of Ownership calculators

These are calculators help you understand potential Azure expenses. Both calculators are accessible from the internet and they allow you to build out a configuration. However they both serve different purposes.

**Pricing Calculator**

This calculator is a tool that helps you calculate an estimate cost of using Azure services. You can input different resources like virtual machine, storage, and networking to get an approximate price. You can even account for different storage options like storage type, access tier and redundancy.

**TCO calculator**

This calculator is designed to help you compare the costs for running an on-premises infrastructure compared to an Azure Cloud infrastructure. With the TCO calculator, you enter your current infrastructure configuration, including servers, databases, storage and outbound network traffic. The TCO compares the anticipated costs for your current environment with an Azure environment supporting the same infrastructure requirements.

By inputting details about your current setup, such as servers, databases, and network traffic, the calculator estimates the total cost of ownership (TCO) for both options. It considers factors like hardware, software, power, labor, and Azure service pricing to provide a side-by-side comparison.
This tool assists in making informed decisions about whether migrating to Azure is financially beneficial for your organization.

# What is Cost Management

**Azure Cost Management** is a tool desinged to help users understand, control and optimize their Azure cloud spending.

*Key features and benefits*

 * *Costs Analysis*: provides detailed breakdowns of Azure costs by various dimensions to identify spending trends and anomalies.

 * *Budgeting*: Enables users to set spending limits and receive alerts when budgets are approaching or exceeding limits.
